## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Cams Biometrics API credentials ([Sign up here](https://developer.camsbiometrics.com))

### Install via pip
```bash
pip install cams-biometrics-mcp
```

### Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/camsunit/cams-mcp.git
cd cams-mcp
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cams-biometrics": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "cams_biometrics_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting Credentials

1. Visit [developer.camsbiometrics.com](https://developer.camsbiometrics.com)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to API Credentials
4. Generate your `client_key` and `pass_code`

         Today's Activity for SN12345:
         • Received: 47 transactions
         • In Queue: 2 pending
         • Pushed: 45 successful
         • Last connected: 10:23 AM
```

### Troubleshoot Issues
```
👤 User: "Device SN67890 is not syncing. What's wrong?"
🤖 Claude: [Calls check_device_health and analyze_device_activity]
         I found the issue:
         • Queue status: Stuck (12 pending)
         • Last retry: Failed at 9:15 AM
         • Webhook response: 500 error
         
         Would you like me to reset the queue?
```

### Reset Queue
```
👤 User: "Yes, reset the queue for SN67890"
🤖 Claude: [Calls reset_device_queue]
         ✅ Queue reset successful for SN67890
         Processing will resume automatically.
```

### Check Migration Status
```
👤 User: "What's the migration status of all my devices?"
🤖 Claude: [Calls migration_status with serial_number="ALL"]
         Migration Status:
         • SN12345: Completed ✅
         • SN67890: In Progress (78%)
         • SN11111: Not Started
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `ping_connection` | Test server connectivity | None |
| `fetch_device_inventory` | Get all registered devices | `client_key`, `pass_code` |
| `check_device_health` | Check device status & health | `client_key`, `pass_code`, `serial_number` (default: "ALL") |
| `analyze_device_activity` | View transaction logs & metrics | `client_key`, `pass_code`, `serial_number` (default: "ALL") |
| `migration_status` | Check device migration status | `client_key`, `pass_code`, `serial_number` (default: "ALL") |
| `reset_device_queue` | Restart stuck data queues | `client_key`, `pass_code`, `serial_number` (required) |

**💡 Tip:** Use `serial_number="ALL"` to query all devices at once (except for `reset_device_queue`).

The MCP server acts as a bridge between Claude and your Cams Biometrics API. All business logic and data remain on your secure backend.

## Security

- ✅ Credentials are passed per-request, not stored
- ✅ All communication over HTTPS
- ✅ MCP server contains no business logic or secrets
- ✅ Backend API handles all authentication and authorization
- ⚠️ Never commit credentials to version control

## Development

### Local Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/camsunit/cams-mcp.git
cd cams-mcp

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the MCP server (for testing)
python -m cams_biometrics_mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
**Problem:** "Connection to server failed"

**Solutions:**
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check if `https://mcp.camsbiometrics.com` is accessible
- Use `ping_connection` tool to test
- Check firewall settings

### Authentication Errors
**Problem:** "Authentication failed" or "Invalid credentials"

**Solutions:**
- Verify your `client_key` and `pass_code` at [developer.camsbiometrics.com](https://developer.camsbiometrics.com)
- Ensure credentials haven't expired
- Check for typos in credentials
- Regenerate credentials if needed

### Device Not Found
**Problem:** "Device SN12345 not found"

**Solutions:**
- Use `fetch_device_inventory` to see all registered devices
- Verify serial number is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check if device is properly registered in your account
- Ensure device license is active

### Queue Stuck
**Problem:** "Queue is stuck" or "Data not syncing"

**Solutions:**
- Use `check_device_health` to diagnose the issue
- Check webhook endpoint availability
- Use `reset_device_queue` to restart processing
- Verify webhook returns expected HTTP status codes
- Contact support if issue persists

### Claude Not Detecting MCP Server
**Problem:** Tools not available in Claude

**Solutions:**
- Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- Verify config file location is correct
- Check JSON syntax in config file
